# EncDec
Privacy Enhancing Encryption Decryption Application used for privacy enhancing. Here the normal text can be encrypted in a custom formulation to secure the original text. Encryption shield is developed in dot NET framework which runs on a web server (IIS), the data is securely stored in a database; here the database is MS SQL which is a Rational Database.

# Deployment
This application runs over a webserver on a framework dot NET. There is an input box where we can enter any text, followed by a button “Encrypt”. The function of the button is to run the encryption script and shows the output in the “Result box”.

# Why EncDec
Sometimes we need to send secret messages to another person but there might be worried about security. If there might be an unknown network or some may be on a network where we don’t have any control over security settings like a corporate network, or a public Wi-Fi network. Then we might not trust sending sensitive data over your work email, or web mail. Even though these systems may be encrypted, someone else has control over the keys so could potentially read your messages. Hence the EncDec tool can be used, where plain text data is encrypted and can then be easily copied to the clipboard or saved as a text file. This text file can then be sent via your normal instant chat/messenger programs or email privately.
